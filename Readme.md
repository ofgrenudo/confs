# Scripts

This is a collection of scripts I use for personal / professional reasons. Feel free to pick these apart and use them for your self.

Most of these are of my own creation, but some of them may be others creation. (WLANMon is a good example of this.) I would say this repository is best viewed as a collection of scripts, from others and my self.
